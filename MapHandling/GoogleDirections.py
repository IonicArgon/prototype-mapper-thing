## so as it currently stands, the Google Maps Embed API does not support waypoint optimization
## the solution for now (because i don't want to switch to JS) is to use the Directions API to get the optimized route
## and then use the waypoint order to display the Embed API map with the optimized route
##NOTE: this costs extra money in the long run, it's more ideal if we made the project in JS to begin with but i already started w/ python b/c i'm more familiar with it
